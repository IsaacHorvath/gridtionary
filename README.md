## Gridtionary - a sliding wordfind game

Gridtionary is a simple browser game where you try to find words in a four by four grid of letters, but there's a twist: you start with one extra letter on the side. Drag it anywhere, and you can shift a row or column of letters over, giving you new word combinations. But beware! This will lower your score.

I'm making this to help brush up on my Javascript. Feel free to suggest features!
